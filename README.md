# Bank-Loan-Prediction
In this study, researchers employed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze a common dataset of approved loans and predict eligible loan applicants. The dataset contained customers' historical data, encompassing factors such as age, income type, loan annuity, last credit bureau report, type of organization they work for, and length of employment. The main objective was to identify the most influential features, i.e., the elements with the greatest impact on the prediction output. Various ML methods, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVC), Lightgbm, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting, and Hyperparameter Tuning, were utilized. These algorithms were compared and evaluated using standard metrics. Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1-Score of 96%. The high F1-Score indicated that the Logistic Regression effectively balanced precision and recall, making it a promising choice for credit approval decisions.
